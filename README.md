# Borrowed Book Database 
_System to keep track of the due dates and number of renewals for borrowed books.._

### What this project does, and why it exists:
If you've ever wanted to keep track of the (hopefully)
many books you've check out, then this is for you. Using
PostgreSQL and C, this project will allow you to make 
queries for books you have checkout, remind you what books
are due, allow you to renew books, even let you make 
sections for different types of books (on a list of features 
that I'm planning to add to this project).

### A small code example:
     


### TODO:
1. Complete all the functions for Book, Date, DBHelper.
2. Initialize user config files, read from them.
3. Write all the documentation.
